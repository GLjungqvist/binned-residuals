# binned-residuals
Python implementation of binned residual plots for regression diagnostics. Creates clear visualizations of model residuals vs predictors using percentile-based binning with confidence intervals. Inspired by R's ARM package.

## Development

To set up the project for development:

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Run:
```bash
uv sync
```

This installs the package in editable mode along with development dependencies (pytest, ruff).
